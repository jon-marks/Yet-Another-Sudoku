<p>Row-Column Subset patterns rely on Base-Set / Cover Set Logic.  These patterns isolate the
intersections of single candidates over a subset of <a class="reference internal" href="../07-glossary.html#term-Group"><span class="xref std std-term">Group</span></a>s.  As discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="../02-foundation/04-base-cover-sets.html#found-bsets-and-csets"><span class="std std-ref">Base
Sets and Cover Sets</span></a> Fish patterns have Group Cover Sets, whereas Subset patterns
have Cell Cover Sets.  It is also possible to have a box as a group in the base set and or cover set
patterns.</p>
<p>Fish are named according to their order, order defines the base set and cover set size for that
fish.
•   2 ==&gt; X-Wing, 2 base sets of order two with 2 cover-sets.
•   3 ==&gt; Swordfish, 3 base sets of order three with 3 cover-sets.
•   4 ==&gt; Jellyfish, 4 base sets of order four with 4 cover sets.</p>
<p>The order of a base-set refers to the times the candidate appears in each base-line (set).</p>
<p>Practically it is unnecessary to look higher than 4 for, because for orders higher than four there is a reciprocal
(9 – order) pattern that can be found.</p>
<p>In principle,  base-sets refer to the existence of a candidate occurring “n” times in “n” non- overlapping houses/groups.  Each base-set is synonymous a house.  Franken Fish refer to fish where one or more of the base-sets are blocks/boxes.  All other fish have base-sets that are either rows or columns.  Because the rows or columns are parallel it is impossible for them to overlap.</p>
<p>In a fish pattern of order “n”, there exist “n” cover-sets (houses) that intersect the n base-sets. Fraken Fish refer to fish where only one or more base-sets are boxes.  Mutant Fish refer to fish where cover-sets  as well as base-sets can be boxes.  Franken and Mutant Fish patterns are difficult to recognise, and very often there are easier patterns to recognise that the Franken/Mutant fish for that step.</p>
<p>Fish where both the base sets and cover sets are lines are much easier to recognise and can be quite productive.</p>
<section id="basic-fish-patterns">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.4.1. </span>Basic Fish Patterns<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-fish-patterns" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Fish patterns rely on the fact that a candidate can only be True once in a house, be the house a base-set or cover-set.  In recognising Fish patterns, base-sets are not allowed to overlap and must have between 2 and n occurrences of the candidate.  Cover-sets also cannot overlap, and each cover set needs to intersect with the same value candidate in at least 2 of the base-sets.  Any same-value candidates in the cover-set that is not intersecting the base-set can be eliminated.</p>
<section id="x-wings">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.4.1.1. </span>X-Wings<a class="headerlink" href="#x-wings" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider the X-Wing example on the left.  The first base-set B0 is row 2 with candidate X only occurring in r2c2 and r2c6.  The second base-set B1 is row 6 with candidate X only occurring in r6c2 and r6c6.  Cover-set C0 col2 intersects r2c2 and r6c2 and cover-C1 intersects r2c6 and r6c6.
In B0, either Xr2c2 or Xr2c6 can be True.  Therefore if Xr2c2 is True, then Xr6c6 is True, and if Xr2c6 is True then Xr6c2 is True.</p>
<p>This logic condition describes the X from which the name X-Wing originates.  That is either the two yellow X’s are True or the two blue X’s are True.  A blue and a yellow X cannot be simultaneously True because they both exist in the same base-set and X can only be true once in a base set. Looking at the cover-sets (green lines), each which contain a yellow X and a blue X.  We know that either the blue X or the yellow X will be True.  Therefore any other candidate X along the cover-set (green lines) that does not belong to a base-set, cannot be True, and therefore can be eliminated.</p>
<p>The X-Wing Truth is that only either the blue X’s or the yellow X’s are True.  Therefore any other X candidate ccell that can see (i.e. in this case, in the same house/group as) both a blue and a yellow X cannot be True and can be eliminated.  As there are no other X’s along the base-sets (by definition of the pattern), the only possible eliminations occur along the cover sets. (The cover sets are the only other houses that contain an X of each colour)</p>
<p>Consider the Swordfish pattern with candidate X in the centre puzzle in the above figure.  The base sets (lines) have been identified as Rows 1, 3 and 7.  Each row can have between two and three occurrences of candidate X,  The Swordfish pattern is recognised by the corresponding 3 column cover-sets each intersecting 2 to 3 base-sets on candidate X. (the blue and yellow X’s).  This image shows a “minimal” Swordfish where each base-set has only two instances of candidate, and each cover set only intersects 2 base-sets.  The light X white cells can also contain candidates optionally without influencing the outcome of this pattern.  What is important is that the union of intersections over the three bases must equal 3.</p>
</section>
<section id="swordfish">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.4.1.2. </span>Swordfish<a class="headerlink" href="#swordfish" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In the Swordfish pattern only one of the (yellow, blue or orange)X’s can be True in any base-set, and in any cover-set.  The yellow, blue and white X cells are the only cells where X can/may be True. As X can only occur once in each of the cover sets, and only has the possibility of occurring in a blue, yellow or white cell, all other occurrences of X along the green lines that is not part of a base-set can be eliminated.</p>
<p>The Swordfish Truth is that either the yellow, blue or Orange X’s are True.  Therefore any other X candidate ccell that can see (same house as) one of each colour X cannot be True and can be eliminated.  By definition of this this Pattern, there is no possibility of this happening along the base sets.  The only other so the only possible eliminations can only occur along the cover-sets.</p>
</section>
<section id="jellyfish">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.4.1.3. </span>Jellyfish<a class="headerlink" href="#jellyfish" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider the Jellyfish pattern with Candidate X in the right puzzle in the above figure.  Rows 1, 3, 5 and 7 are base sets with between two and 4 occurrences of Candidate X.  The Jellyfish pattern is recognised by the corresponding four column cover sets, each intersecting between 2 and 4 base-sets on the X candidate.  The image shows a minimal Jellyfish with dark X’s in blue and yellow cells; where there are two candidates in each base set and two cover-set intersections (the yellow and blue cells).  The presence of The light X candidates in the orange and magenta cells does not influence the outcome of this pattern.  What is important to the Jellyfish pattern is that the union of intersecting Candidates in all base-sets must equal 4.</p>
<p>In this Jellyfish pattern, X can only occur once in each base (one of the blue, yellow, Orange or Magenta cells).  As X can also only occur once in each cover set, and it is constrained to one of the blue, yellow, white of pink cells, any other occurrence of X along the cover-sets (green cells) can be eliminated.</p>
<p>The Jellyfish Truth is that either all the yellow, or all the blue, or all the orange or all the magenta X’s are True.  Therfore any other X candidate ccell that can see (in the same house as) one of each colour X cannot be True and can be eliminated.  By definition there is no possibility of this happening along the base-sets, so the only possible eliminations can occur along the cover-sets.</p>

<p>Many times, fish patterns are almost formed, save for one of the base-sets having extra candidates.  Those extra candidates along the base-set are known as Fins.  Here, if certain conditions are met, eliminations are still possible.</p>
<section id="finned-x-wing">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.4.2.1. </span>Finned X-Wing<a class="headerlink" href="#finned-x-wing" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Considering the Finned X-Wing on the right,  A fin is added to the previous X-Wing in Base B0, Xr2c8.  The fin can either be True or False.  If the fin is False, then the original X-Wing as previously explained is True. That is, either the blue X’s or the yellow X’s are True.  If the Fin is True, then any other Candidate that sees (that is, in it’s row, column or box/block house/group) the Fin cannot be be True.  In this pattern, the Fin’s row house is also the X-Wing’s B0.  If the Fin is True, neither the blue X and yellow X in B0 can be True negating the X-Chain’s Truth.  Any Cover that can see all of a blue X, a yellow X and the Fin, can be eliminated, because we have shown that one of them must be True.</p>
<p>Another way of saying this is:  Any Candidate that lies in the intersection of the Fish’s Truth set and the Fin’s Truth Set can be eliminated.  The Fish’s Truth Set are the cover-set cells that are not part of the base-sets.  And the Fin’s Truth Set are the other cells in the row, column and box/block in which that Fin resides.  In the above X-Wing pattern, these are the light green cells r12c7. This assertion can be further narrowed to. Any candidate in the intersection of the Fish’s cover-set and Box of the Fin that is not part of the Finned Fish pattern can be eliminated.</p>
<p>A Finned Fish pattern can have multiple Fins.  The Fins need be grouped such that they are present in the same X-Wing Base-Set in the same Box/Group as the Fin.  Thus, if one of the Fins are True, the X-Wing Truth is negated, and if both Fins are False, the X-Wing Truth prevails.  Both Fins cannot be simultaneously True because they are in the same house.  It is clear to see there can only be 1 or 2 fins in Finned Fish.</p>
<p>The finned X-Wing on the right shows the possibility of two bases each having a fin if the finned bases are in the same chute.  Because the bases are in the same chute f1 and the fins are in the same house b3, any cover not part of a base-set that can see both fins such as Xr2c7 can be eliminated.</p>

<p>Considering the Finned Swordfish in the right. The intersection of the Red Fin’s Truth set with the Swordfish’s Truth set is r13c7.  Any X candidate in these two cells r13c7 can be eliminated.</p>
<p>The following Finned Swordfish only exists because of the Xr8c6 fin.  This is a valid swordfish because each base set has two or more members, and each cover set has two or more members, even though the base-set with the fin only has two members including the fin.  Here, in B2 either Xr8c3 is True or Xr8c6 is True.  If Xr8c3 is True, then the reduced X-Wing in Xr24c57 ensures that any X in c5 or c7 that is not part of the reduced X-Wing can be eliminated.  If Xr8c6 is True, then any X in box 8 can be eliminated.  The intersection of both conditions makes the elimination of X in r7c5 and r9c5.</p>
<p>The Finned Swordfish on the right shows the possibility of two bases, B1 and B2 each having a fin (Xr4c4 and Xr6c6 respectively) in a house b5.  Because cover Xr5c5 can see both fins it can see both fins, it can be eliminated.</p>

<p>Considering the Finned Jellyfish on the left of the figure.  The intersection of the Red Fin’s Truth set with the Jellyfish’s Truth set yields the four cells r13c79</p>
<p>This Finned Jellyfish only exists because of the presence of the Fin Xr2c8.  Either Xr2c3 or Xr2c8 can be True.  If Xr2C3 is True, then a reduced Swordfish Xr469c579 is formed making the elimination of any X not part of the pattern in c5, c7 and c9 possible.  If Xr2c8 is True, then any other X in box 3 can be eliminated.  The intersection of these two conditions makes the elimination of X from r13c79 possible.</p>
<p>This Finned Jellyfish shows the possibility of two bases B1 and B2 each having a fin (Xr4c1 and Xr6c2 respectively) in house b4.  Because cover Xr5c3 can see both fins, it can be eliminated.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">3.4.3. </span>Sashimi Fish Patterns<a class="headerlink" href="#sashimi-fish-patterns" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>As with Finned Fish, many times Fish patterns are almost formed, save for one missing candidate.  These patterns are also known as Degenerate Fish.  If certain requirements are met, eliminations are possible.  The general form of a Sashimi fish is (n) base-sets, (n)-1 cover-sets and 2 or 3 fins.  A Sashimi pattern ensures that only one of the Fins can be True.  Therefore any ccell that can see all fins, can be eliminated.</p>
<section id="sashimi-x-wing">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.4.3.1. </span>Sashimi X-Wing<a class="headerlink" href="#sashimi-x-wing" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider the Sashimi X-Wing image on the right.  There are two base-sets of two candidates each, B0, and B1, but only 1 cover-set of two candidates C0.  As an aside this pattern is also recognised as a Skycraper.  As the Red X’s are their only cover, like Fins, they are treated as fins (even though they are not confined to a single base-set.</p>
<p>If Fin Xr3c8 is True, Xr3c3 is False, Xr7c3 is True making Xr7c7. False.  Similarly if Xr7c7 is True, Xr3c8 is False.  One one Fin can be True, never both or none.  If either fin is True, the candidate ccells that see both Fins can be eliminated. If X is present can be eliminated from the green cells.  The two fins need to be at least confined to a single chute for eliminations to be made, the third Tower in this case.  If the bases were in the same floor chute, then eliminations can be made from all other cells in the box/block containing the fins (floor – tower chute intersection) that are not in the base-sets with up to 3 fins across the 2 base-sets .  If the Fins were in different chutes then only the ccell that sees both fins lies on a base-set row with no X candidate in that location.</p>
<p>Consider the Sashimi X-Wing on the right.  It is the same as the above Sashimi X-Wing, except for an additional Fin in B1, Xr7c9.  In this case, the only ccells that can see all 3 fins are confined to the two green cells.  If X is present in either of those two cells (that is the ccells exist), they can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Consider the Sashimi X-Wing on the right.  Not only are the 2 (or 3)  fins confined to a cover chute, they are also confined to a base street.  That is the fins are confined to a block/box.  Applying the rule that ccells that are not part of the base-set that see all the fins can be eliminated, results in up to three ccells in the row in the base chute that is not a base set.</p>

<section id="sashimi-swordfish">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.4.3.2. </span>Sashimi Swordfish<a class="headerlink" href="#sashimi-swordfish" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Considering the Sashimi Swordfish on the right.  3 Base-sets of between 2 and 3 candidates exist, B0, B1, B2, and only two cover-sets exist with two or more candidates, C0 and C1.  There are fins in at least 2 base-sets (B0 and B2).  Fins are bound to a cover chute (Third tower in this case).  The two fins are Xr2c8 and Xr8c7.</p>
<p>Following the logic of this Sashimi Swordfish, if the fin Xr2c8 is True, then the other Candidates in B0 are False.  Either the blue or yellow cell in B1 can be True.  If B1 Blue is True, then B2 Blue is True making the other Fin Xr8c7 False.  If B1 yellow is True, then if B2 orange existed it would be True, again making the Fin Xr8c7 False.  Because it does not exist. This specific pattern also resolves B1 Blue and B2 Blue as True, which again keeps  Xr8c7 False.  If Xr8c7 is True, B2 Blue is False, Making B1 yellow True, B1 blue False, which forces B0 yellow True, making the Fin Xr8c7 False.</p>
<p>Thus we have determined that any ccell that is not part of the base-set that can see all the fins can be eliminated.  The two identified fins are confined to a Cover chute (third tower).  The only ccells that fit this criteria are shaded green.</p>
<p>The Sashimi Swordfish image on the right is the same as above  except for the additional fin in B0, Xr2c9.  Here The Fins are confined to only two boxes in the cover chute.  The only ccells that can see all Fins are highlighted green.  If X is present in any of the green cells, the X can be eliminated.</p>
<p>If the two or three fins are confined to a base chute (floors in this case), as shown on the right, all the ccells that are not part of a base-set that see all the fins can be eliminated.  As the Fins are confined to a box in two of the bases, any ccell in the other non base line can be eliminated, as shown by the green cells.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">3.4.3.3. </span>Sashimi Jellyfish<a class="headerlink" href="#sashimi-jellyfish" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Considering the Sashimi Jellyfish in the above right figure.  The 4 base sets of between 2 and candidates are B0, B1, B2 and B3 and the 3 covers are C1, C2, C3, and fins Xr2c3 and Xr6c1.  If Fin Xr2c3 is True, then the other candidates in the Base-set B0 are False.  The resulting (n)-1 (Swordfish) pattern in B1, B2 B3/C1, C2,C3 will ensure that Fin Xr6c1 is False.  Similarly, if Fin Xr6c1 is True, the remaining candidates in B2 are False.  The resulting (n)-1 (Swordfish) pattern in B0, B1, B3, C1,C2,C3, ensures that Fin Xr2c3 is False.</p>
<p>Thus, we have determined that either the Swordfish in Xr579c468 is valid or one of the Red Fins are True.  Therefore, any ccell that is not in a base-set that can see all the fins can be eliminated (as identified by the green shaded cells.</p>
<p>The Sashimi Jellyfish on the right is exactly the same as above, except it has an additional Fin in B1, Xr4c2.  Here the Fins are confined to only two boxes in the cover chute.  The only ccells that can see all Fins are highlighted green.  If X is present in any of the green cells, the X can be eliminated.</p>
<p>If the two or three fins are confined to a base chute (floors in this case), as shown on the right, all the ccells that are not part of a base-set that see all the fins can be eliminated.  As the Fins are confined to a box in two of the bases, any ccell in the other non base line can be eliminated, as shown by the green cells.</p>

<p>Searching for kraken fish patterns is hugely expensive, and is done twice, first time in the search for  regular scalar chains, and again for chains with group links.  As Kraken Fish are considered rather exotic and because of the time taken to resolve, Kraken Fish are at the end of the list for patterns to search.</p>
<p>Therefore, with Kraken fish, we search for the first found cover that can see all fins, rather than exhaustively searching for all covers that can see all fins.</p>

<dt>The following example from Systematic Sudoku (taken from KrazyDad SuperTough 555) is interesting in that the X-Wing fin “sees” a candidate in the column cover-set by way of the Weakly linked AIC on 6: 6(r5c5~r2c5=r3c4~r3c3). [remember, “~” is the symbol for a strong link masquerading as a weak link].   In this example, it is the only way the fin 6r5c5 sees the cover ccell 6r3c3.  The other cover ccell 6r6c3 is not visible from the fin.  Other probably simpler solutions:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Notice that the ERs in box 4 on both 6 and 1 candidates, coupled with the 61 conjugate pair (61r36c4) results in the elimination of both the 1 and 6 from r3c3 (r3c3-=61) solving r3c3:=2, and the rest of the puzzle is solved with simple singles.</p></li>
<li><p>Noticing the exposed pair in 2(r18c2) causing r2c2-=1 and r6c2-=1. followed by r456c1 describing a pointing locked single in b2, causing the elimination of r3c3-=1.  Followed by the Turbot Fish in 1(r2c1=r2c5-r8c5=r7c6) causing the elimination of r6c1-=1.</p></li>
<li><p>A Skyscraper 1(r2c5=r2c1-r7c1=r7c6) or (Sashimi) Finned X-Wing (r27c1, r2c5, r7c6) both resulting in the elimination r8c5-= 1.</p></li>

<p>In this example, the would-be 6-wing is spoiled by the extra fin 6r5c5. If the fin could be wished away, the perfected 6-wing would eliminate 6r3c3 and 6r6c3. But 6r3c3 sees that fin, via 6-chain. If 6r3c3 is true, it will erase the fin, allowing the fish to prove it false.  Potential victim 6r6c3 escapes the fish because it cannot see the fin. <a class="reference external" href="https://sySudoku.com/guide/sySudoku-advanced/x-panel-methods/finned-and-kraken-fish/">https://sySudoku.com/guide/sySudoku-advanced/x-panel-methods/finned-and-kraken-fish/</a></p>
<p>Another Kraken X-Wing follows from  Systematic Sudoku.</p>
<p>Here, YAS finds a different Kraken X-Wing solution.  This one formed with base set rows, because YAS searches row bases before column bases.</p>
<p>The pattern found is:  7r46c68,r4c3; together with the weakly linked chain from cover 7r5c6 to fin 7r4c3: 7r5c6-1r5c6=1r5c2~1r6c2=9r6c2~9r6c9=9r4c9~6r4c9=6r4c3-7r4c3.  This results in the elimination of the cover r5c6-=7</p>
