My appreciation of Sudoku logic is documented here, Following is a list of website links read and watched.  Additionally, the text is peppered with specific web page links where the specific reference is applied.

Researching, I found the following refs for the basis of this work.
    1. Sudopedia: http://sudopedia.enjoysudoku.com/  Most useful for its solving techniques reference.  Not everything listed is explained or explained in sufficient detail but reference to search elsewhere.
    2. Hodoku:  Bernhard Hobiger website.  Bernhard passed away (last updates are 2013 on his website).  Site and program contain a very comprehensive list of solving techniques, training and learning, a very good start for me to base my program on.
