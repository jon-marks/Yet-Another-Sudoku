Human Solvable Patterns
=======================

Human solvable patterns rely on logic that is not too complicated and involved to resolve.  As
expertise in solving puzzles improves, one can resolve more complicated patterns, so it is a matter
of personal judgement where to draw the "too complicated" line.

Practically, a point of diminishing returns exists between:
   *  the complexity of the pattern,
   *  the complexity of the logic to resolve the pattern, and
   *  the probability of the patternâ€™s occurrence.

This text does not claim to be an exhaustive coverage of all possible conditional logic techniques.
There is often patterns that can be solved with two or more techniques.  An objective of this 
treatise is to present a set of techniques that can be used to solve any puzzles.

However, as logic techniques get more complex and involve many variables they in turn become too
complex and take too long for even the expert mere mortals among us without some high speed 
computational assistance.  Some such techniques are presented, and it is left to the reader to 
decide for themselves where computer aided logic solving starts, At least the most simplest patterns
of these complex techniques can be solved unaided. 

Where multiple techniques can resolve a pattern, I favour the most generalised technique or the one
with broadest reach, unless it is much more complex than another technique.

Many resources on the internet document the identification and resolution of patterns
effectively. I reference all sources, and often, rather than rehashing their information, I, with 
gratitude, defer to them.
