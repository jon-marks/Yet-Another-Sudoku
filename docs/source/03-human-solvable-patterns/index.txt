Human Solvable Patterns
=======================

The distinction between what is human solvable and what is computer solvable has a wide, murky,
and subjective middle ground.  With experience and practice this middle ground narrows towards
computer solvable end.

Practically, there comes a point of diminishing returns between:
   *  the complexity of the pattern,
   *  the complexity of the logic to resolve the pattern, and
   *  the probability of the patternâ€™s occurrence.

This text does not claim to be an exhaustive coverage of all possible conditional logic techniques.
The decision of what or not to include is subjective especially when it comes to those esoteric and
convoluted techniques involving a mix of other complex techniques.

Many patterns can be identified and resolved by more than one logic technique.  Where multiple
techniques can resolve a pattern, the technique with the broadest reach is favoured, unless it is
rather more complex than another technique.
