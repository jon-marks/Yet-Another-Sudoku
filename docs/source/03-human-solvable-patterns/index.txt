Human Solvable Patterns
=======================

Human solvable patterns rely on logic that is not too complicated and involved to resolve.  As
expertise in solving puzzles improves, one can resolve more complicated patterns

Practically, a point of diminishing returns exists between:
   *  the complexity of the pattern,
   *  the complexity of the logic to resolve the pattern, and
   *  the probability of the patternâ€™s occurrence.

This text is not an exhaustive coverage of all possible conditional logic techniques.
The decision of what or not to include is subjective especially when it comes to those esoteric and
convoluted techniques involving a mix of other complex techniques.

Many patterns can be identified and resolved by more than one logic technique.  Where multiple
techniques can resolve a pattern, the technique with the broadest reach is favoured, unless it is
rather more complex than another technique.
