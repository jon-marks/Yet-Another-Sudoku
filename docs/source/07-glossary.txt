   **A Truth**
      A :term:`Set` of :term:`Ccell` :term:`Element`\s where at least one of the (yet to be
      determined) elements is True.

   **AI**
      Alternating Inferences - A patterns where adjacent links between nodes alternate strong and
      weak.

   **AIC**
      Alternating Inference Chain.  A Chain made up with alternating Strong and Weak Links.

   **Band**
      See :term:`Chute`.

   **Bi-value Cell**
      A cell on a Sudoku board containing only 2 candidate values.  A :term:`Strong Link` exists between
      these two candidates in that cell.

   **Block**
      See :term:`Box`.

   **Board**
      A solved, filled or completed puzzle.

   **Box**
      A 3x3 Grid.  A Sudoku :term:`Grid` is made up of 9 boxes, 3 accross, 3 down.
      Also known as a Block.

   **Ccell**
      A three dimensional tuple uniquely identifying a candidate element by value, row,
      and column in a Sudoku Grid.

   **Cell**
      A location in a Sudoku grid into which a Given is present or a Solved value can be placed.

   **Chain Patterns**
      Chain patterns refer to the collection of Chain, Net and Loop patterns, typically referring
      to :term:`AI` Chains

   **Chute**
      A grouping of three :term:`Box`\es in a row or a column.
      Three boxes in a row is a :term:`Floor`.  Three boxes in a column is a :term:`Tower`.
      Also known as a Band.

   **Column**
      A vertical line of 9 cells in a Sudoku :term:`Grid`.

   **Conjugate Pair**
      The only two same value candidates in a house forming a :term:`Strong Link`.  This is a
      reference to the candidates not the links – a subtle distinction.

   **Eliminations**
      Removing Ccells in puzzles that have been determined impossible to be True.

   **Element**
      A :term:`Ccell` that is a member of a Set in a pattern.

   **Floor**
      A row oriented :term:`Chute`.

   **Givens**
      The initial filled values in cells of a Sudoku puzzle.

   **Grid**
      9x9 grid, subdivided into 9  – 3x3 :Term:`Box`\es  (Blocks) on to which Sudoku puzzles are
      spatially represented.

   **Group**
      See :term:`House`.

   **House**
      A specific nine cell :term:`Row`, :term:`Column` or :term:`box` in a Sudoku :term:`Grid`.
      Also known as a Group, Sector, or Unit.

   **Line**
      Either a :term:`Row` or a :term:`Column`.

   **Link**
      A relationship between two Nodes (Ccells) in a pattern.

   **Loop**
      An (:term:`AI`) :term`Chain` that loops back on itself closing the chain.


   **Node**
      A :term:`Ccell` that is linked to other nodes in a pattern.

   **Pattern**
      An arrangement of Ccells that have the potential of yielding eliminations or placements

   **Placement**
      Placing of a single solved value in a Cell.

   **Puzzle**
      A partially completed Sudoku in a puzzle, it may only be populated with the givens or with
      givens and some solved values.

   **Robust Link**
      An inference between two Ccells at the ends of a Strongly Ended Alternating Inference Chain.
      Neither end can be simultaneously False, and at least one end is always True

   **Row**
       A horizontal line of 9 cells in a Sudoku :term:`Grid`.

   **SE-AIC**
      Strong Link Ended Alternating Inference Chain.  A chain pattern of even Node count where the
      end links are both Strong.  The ends of a SE-AIC form a :term:`Robust Link`.

   **Sector**
      See :term:`House`.

   **Set**
      A grouping of :term:`Ccell` :term:`Element`\s in a :term:`pattern`. Often the grouping of
      elements that form :term:`A Truth`.

   **SLC**
      Strong Link Chain.  A Chain where all the links between Nodes are strong.

   **SLN**
      Strong Link Net.  A Net where all the links between Nodes are strong.

   **Strong Link**
      An inference between two Ccells where neither can be simultaneously False, nor simultaneously
      True.  If one Ccell is True, the other is False and vice-versa.

   **Super-Node**
      The set of :ref:`'same parity/state nodes' in a Strong Linked Chain <super-node>`, Net or Loop, that is strongly linked to
      the opposing Super-Nodes.

   **Tower**
      A Column oriented :term:`Chute`.

   **WE-AIC**
      Weak Link Ended Alternating Inference Chain.  A chain pattern of even Node count where the
      end links are both Strong.

   **Weak Link**
      An inference between two Ccells where neither can be simultaneously True, and at least one end
      is always False.  A Weak Link is formed by 3 or more same valued candidates in a
      house or three or more candidates in a cell.

   **Unit**
      See :term:`House`.

Peers/Buddies:	The Peers/Buddies of a cell are the other cells in the combined row, column and block
groups.  By Sudoku rules all Peers are have unique numbers, Peers cannot have the same values.
Peers/Buddies are said to “see” each other.





Peers/Buddies:	The Peers/Buddies of a cell are the other cells in the combined row, column and block groups.  By Sudoku rules all Peers are have unique numbers, Peers cannot have the same values..  Peers/Buddies are said to each other.
Intersection/Overlap:	Where 2 Groups/Houses share one or more cells.  The shared cell(s) where a row and column cross, or when a row or column crosses a block.
Conflict/Contradiction/Error:	Two or more cells with the same value in a Group/House.
Minimal Puzzle:	A minimal puzzle is that where no more holes can be dug without the puzzle becoming invalid, that is having multiple solutions. 
Candidate:	A possible solved value for an unsolved cell.  This definition has a finer distinction in that is only a reference to the candidate value, irrespective of the Cell it is found in.  A Ccell defines a potential solved value for a cell by its value and Cell coordinates. In solving puzzles candidates are whittled away (eliminated) using logic techniques until only one candidate remains, which is the Solved value.
Slink:	Strong link in a chain or a loop 
Wink	Weak link in a chain or a loop 
Ccell	Refers to a candidate value in a cell as a unique identifier comprising the candidate, row and column coordinates as a tuple.  For example 3r2c8 candidate 3 in row 2, column 8..  This reference is useful when referring to specific candidates in specific cells, and is used extensively in the explanation of many logic techniques and their algorithms.   In solving puzzles Ccells are whittled away (eliminated) using logic techniques until only one Ccell remains as the solution for that cell. 
Sudoku Rules	The collective term for: 
* The numbers 1 through 9 only occur once in each row, column and block. 
* Only one unique solution. 
Conjugate Pair.	The two same value candidates in a house forming a strong link. 
Bi-Value Cell (BVC)	A cell containing only two candidates. 
AIC	Alternating Inference Chain.  A chain comprising alternating Weak and Strong links. 
Linebox	The intersection of a line (row or column) and a box comprising only three cells. 
Rowbox	The intersection of row and box comprising only three cells 
Colbox	The intersection of a column and box comprising only three cells.
