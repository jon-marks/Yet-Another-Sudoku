      Also known as a Block.

   **Buddy**
      See :term:`Peer`.

   **Candidate**
      A possible solved value for an unsolved cell.  This definition is only a reference to the
      candidate value, not to any :term:`Cell` location on the :term:`Grid`.

      to :term:`Alternating Inference` Chains

   **Chain**
      Chain is short for Inference Chain, a stream of inference links connecting Ccells to each
      other.

   **Chute**
      A grouping of three :term:`Box`\es in a row or a column.
      Three boxes in a row is a :term:`Floor`.  Three boxes in a column is a :term:`Tower`.

   **Column**
      A vertical line of 9 cells in a Sudoku :term:`Grid`.

   **Conditional Logic**
      The process of asserting a Premise and following a sequence of inferences to a
      possible logical outcome.  See :ref:`cc_premises_and_inferences`

   **Conjugate Pair**
      The only two same value candidates in a house forming a :term:`Strong Link`.  This is a
      reference to the candidates not the links between them – a subtle distinction.

   **Given**
      An initially placed value on a Sudoku.  It is the Given placements that make the puzzle.

   **Grid**
      9x9 grid, subdivided into 9  – 3x3 :Term:`Box`\es  (Blocks) on to which Sudoku puzzles are
      spatially represented.

   **Group**
      See :term:`House`.

   **House**
      A specific nine cell :term:`Row`, :term:`Column` or :term:`Box` in a Sudoku :term:`Grid`.
      Also known as a Group, Sector, or Unit.

   **Interior Node**
      In an AI-Chain of Nodes, the Interior Nodes lie between the :term:`End Node`\s.

   **Intersection**
     The cells common to two Groups that intersect.

   **Line**
      Either a :term:`Row` or a :term:`Column`.

   **Link**
      A logical relationship between two Nodes (Ccells).  The logical relationship can be one of
      a :term:`Weak Link`, a :term:`Strong Link` or a :term:`Robust Link`.
      See :ref:`cc_premises_and_inferences`

   **Loop**
      An (:term:`AI`) :term:`Chain` that loops back on itself closing the chain.

   **Node**
      A :term:`Ccell` that is linked by :term:`Conditional Logic` to other nodes in a pattern.

   **Parity**
      The collective pronoun for the terms Odd and Even, which are the parity of the sequence
      numbers assigned to a :term:`SLN` or :term:`SLC`.

      In an SLC, applying the premise that one end is True, consecutive nodes will alternate
      True / False until the chain end is reached.  Similarly, applying the premise that that end is
      False, consecutive nodes will alternate False / True until the chain end is reached.

      In an SLN, applying the premise that the root is True, nodes at consecutive node
      levels will alternate True / False through to all the leaves.  Similarly, applying the premise
      that the root is False, nodes at consecutive node levels will alternate False / True through
      to all the leaves.

      Therefore, in either an SLC or SLN, adjacent Nodes alternate in :term:`State`. Although the
      State of a Node may not be known, its neighbours will always have opposing State.
      Consecutively numbering the Nodes in an SLC or Node levels in an SLN, the numbers, and hence
      the Nodes will either have Odd or Even parity.

      Parity (Odd or Even) is used to represent State where the actual State value (True or False)
      is not known.  All Nodes in an SLN with the same Parity will have the same State, even though
      the actual value of that State is yet to be determined.

   **Pattern**
      An arrangement of Ccells that have the potential of yielding eliminations or placements

   **Pattern Cell**
      Reference to a Cell containing Candidates belonging to a pattern

   **PE**
      A Abbreviation of :term:`Potential Elimination`, synonymous with :term:`Ccell`.

   **Peer**
      A :term:`Ccell` that can :term:`See` other Ccells.  Peers are a set of Ccells that see
      each other.

   **Placement**
      Placing of a single solved value in a Cell.

   **Pincer**
      A :term:`Cell` containing :term:`Candidate`\s outside the :term:`Intersection` of two
      :term:`Line`\s, a :term:`Row`, and a :term:`Column`.  Referred to with :term:`Pivot`.

   **Pivot**
      A :term:`Cell` containing :term:`Candidate`\s in the :term:`Intersection` of two
      :term:`Line`\s, a :term:`Row`, and a :term:`Column`.  Reffered to with :term:`Pincer`.

   **Potential Elimination**
      A reference to a Candidate that is an element of the solution set of Candidates in that Cell.
      Through the application of :term:`Conditional Logic` Potential Eliminations are removed from
      this set until the last value remains as the solution for that Cell.

   **Puzzle**

      can be True in a cell becoming the placed value.

      :term:`See` all instances of its value in the Bent Subset grouping.  This is a special
      case of an :term:`Unrestricted Candidate Set` (:ref:`found_unlocked_sets`) with a single
      member.

   **Unrestricted Candidate Set**
      In :ref:`found_unlocked_sets`, an Unrestricted Candidate Set is that set of Candidates that
      cannot :term:`See` all instances of its value in the Unlocked Sets pattern.

   **WE-AIC**
      Weak Link Ended Alternating Inference Chain.  A chain pattern of even Node count where the
      end links are both Strong.

   **Weak Link**
      An inference between two Ccells where neither can be simultaneously True, and at least one end
      is always False.  A Weak Link is formed by 3 or more same valued candidates in a
      house or three or more candidates in a cell.

   **YMMV**
      "Your milage may vary". Your opinion or experience may be different to mine.





Intersection/Overlap:	Where 2 Groups/Houses share one or more cells.  The shared cell(s) where a row and column cross, or when a row or column crosses a block.
Conflict/Contradiction/Error:	Two or more cells with the same value in a Group/House.
Minimal Puzzle:	A minimal puzzle is that where no more holes can be dug without the puzzle becoming invalid, that is having multiple solutions. 
Slink:	Strong link in a chain or a loop
Wink	Weak link in a chain or a loop 
Ccell	Refers to a candidate value in a cell as a unique identifier comprising the candidate, row and column coordinates as a tuple.  For example 3r2c8 candidate 3 in row 2, column 8.
This reference is useful when referring to specific candidates in specific cells, and is used extensively in the explanation of many logic techniques and their algorithms.   In solving puzzles Ccells are whittled away (eliminated) using logic techniques until only one Ccell remains as the solution for that cell.
Sudoku Rules	The collective term for: 
* The numbers 1 through 9 only occur once in each row, column and block. 
* Only one unique solution. 
Conjugate Pair.	The two same value candidates in a house forming a strong link. 
Bi-Value Cell (BVC)	A cell containing only two candidates. 
AIC	Alternating Inference Chain.  A chain comprising alternating Weak and Strong links. 
Linebox	The intersection of a line (row or column) and a box comprising only three cells. 
Rowbox	The intersection of row and box comprising only three cells 
Colbox	The intersection of a column and box comprising only three cells.
