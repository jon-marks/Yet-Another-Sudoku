.. title:: Yet Another Sudoku | Foundation

==========
Foundation
==========

This foundation is organised into a logical consistent flow explaining concepts
and how the concepts are related.

In the effort to be consistent and unambiguous, some terms have been refined or
renamed such that they are:

*  less overloaded,
*  more consistent,
*  more self descriptive, and
*  relate better within the context that they are described.

To keep the reach of this text as wide as possible, verbal or algorithmic descriptions replace less
common symbols used for mathematical operations.
