Language
********

Agreement on a common language, that is comprehensive, and comprehensible to describe
and communicate Sudoku puzzles, concepts, patterns and resolutions,
appears to be lacking in the literature surveyed.  Without it, a `Confusion of Tongues
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel#Confusion_of_tongues>`_ as in the building of the Tower
of Babel prevails.  This is my attempt to draw from what I consider best practices in the literature
and put forward a precise, consistent and unambiguous language for Sudoku.  The notation is loosely
based on and develops from `Eureka <http://sudopedia.enjoysudoku.com/Eureka.html>`_

Sudoku Language Syntax
======================

Location Specifiers
-------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :align: left
   :width: 97%

   *  -  ``r6c5``
      -  The cell in location row 6, column 5 in the 9x9 cell grid
   *  -  ``b4``
      -  The cells in box 4.
   *  -  ``b4p5``
      -  The cell in box 4, position 5, boxes and positions in boxes are counted left to right then
         top to bottom, translates to ``r5c2``
   *  -  ``r2``
      -  The cells in row 2
   *  -  ``c6``
      -  The cells in column 6
   *  -  ``5r2c6``
      -  The candidate 5 in cell ``r2c6``
   *  -  ``r34c245``
      -  The grid of 6 cells – ``r3c2``, ``r3c4``, ``r3c5``, ``r4c2``, ``r4c4`` and ``r4c5``
   *  -  ``r2r5,r3c456,r56c56``
      -  A collection of cells in a comma separated list
   *  -  ``r2c!378``
      -  All the cells in row 2 excluding ``r2c378``
   *  -  ``r!34c6``
      -  All the cells in column 6 excluding ``r35c6``

Ccell Specifiers
----------------

.. list-table::

      -  The Ccell of candidate 3 in row 6 column 5.
   *  -  ``3r6``
      -  All Ccells with candidate value 3 in row 6
   *  -  ``347b6p2``
      -  Three ccells with candidate values 3, 4, 7 in block 2 position 2 (same as ``r4c8``)

Operators
---------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :align: left
   :width: 97%

   *  -  ``:=``
      -  Placement of a value in a cell, eg. ``r4c5:=5``
   *  -  ``-=``
      -  Elimination of a ccell or ccells - candidate(s) from a cell eg. ``r7c2-=24``

Conditionals
------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :align: left
   :width: 97%

   *  -  ``==``
      -  Presence of only value or candidates in cells  eg. ``23==r2c57``
   *  -  ``~=``
      -  Presence of only 2 or more of specified candidates in each specified cell in a cell grouping,
         such that union of candidates in specified cells match specified candidates. eg.  ``347~=r2c456``,
         or ``347~=r2Ib2`` - ``r2Ib2`` are the three cells lying in the intersection of ``r2Ib2``,
   *  -  ``--``
      -  Presence of at least the specified candidate(s) in cells e.g. ``34—r2c8``.  This relationship is also
         specified by ``34r2c8``, a shorthand where the “--” is implied.
   *  -  ``~-``
      -  Presence of at least one instance of each specified candidate, amongst other candidates in a cell
         grouping.  ``34~-r3Ib3``
   *  -  ``!-``
      -  Absence of candidate(s) in cells, eg. ``34!-r2c235``

Relational Specifiers

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :align: left
   :width: 97%

   *  -  ``#``
      -  Count, eg. ``17#2r3`` candidates 1 and 7 occur twice in row 3

      -  Weak Link between two ccells. If X is True then Y is False and if X is False then Y is Unknown
   *  -  ``|-|``
      -  Weak Chain – Chain creates a Weak Link between its ends
   *  -  ``|=|``
      -  Strong Chain – Chain creates a Strong Link between its ends
   *  -  ``|~|``
      -  Robust Chain – Chain creates a link that behaves opposite to a weak link. If X is True, Y is Unknown
         and if X is False then Y is True
   *  -  ``( ... )``
      -  Parenthesis – Associative contraction: ``5r3c2=3r3c2 is the same as (5=3)r3c2``

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :align: left
   :width: 97%

   *  -  ``/``
      -  Restricted Candidate, e.g. ``3/456r3Ub2`` - 4 is the restricted candidate.
   *  -  ``\``
      -  Unrestricted Candidate, e.g. ``34\56c7Ub4`` - 5 is the unrestricted candidate.

Sudoku Language Semantics
=========================

How to read and interpret this Sudoku language syntax is explained with examples.  The significance and
resolution of these patterns is left to later sections.

Note:
   1. Values always precede operators and/or cell specifiers when describing or specifying a pattern.
   2. Values always follow an operator when cell(s) are being modified (either assigning a value or eliminating a Ccell).
   3. A Ccell that is part of a structure such as a Chain or Net is always called a Node to distinguish it from other
      Ccells that are not part of the structure.

Singles
-------

**Exposed Single**
   ``3==r7c1``
      3 is the only candidate in r7c1 and can be placed.

**Hidden Single**
   ``3#1b7,b7p3``
      3 occurs only once in box 7, and that is in position 3.

**Pointing Locked Singles**
   ``7r9c12,!-b7``
      7 occurs in r9, only in cells r9c1, and r9c2, and nowhere else in box 7.
      Therefore, the pattern is locked to row 9.

**Claiming Locked Single**
   ``4r45c2,!-c2``
      4 occurs in column 2, only in cells r4c2 and r5c2, and nowhere else in column 2.
      Therefore, the pattern is locked to box 4.

**Empty Rectangles**
   ``7#4b4,r4,c3;7r4c4=7r7c4``
      7 occurs 4 times in box 4 describing lines r4 and c3 and 7r4c4 is strongly linked to 7r7c4.

(Straight) Subsets
------------------

**Exposed Pair**
   ``56==r4c59``
      In row 4, only candidates 5 and 6 present in r4c5 and r4c9

**Exposed Triple**
   ``14==r3c1,15==r3c5,145==r3c6``
      In row 3, only candidates 1 and 4 in r3c1, 1 and 5 in r3c5, and 145 in r3c6

**Exposed Quad**
   ``5789==r4c4,579==r4c5,78==r4c6,5789==r4c8``
      In row 4, only candidates 5, 7, 8 and 9 in r4c4, only 5, 7 and 9 present in r4c5, only 7 and
      8 present in r4c6, and only 5, 7, 8, and 9 present in r4c8

**Exposed Locked Pair**
   ``68==r89c1``
      In both column 1 and box 7, Only candidates 6 and 8 are present

**Exposed Locked Pair**
   ``345==r2c4,45==r2c5,35==r2c6``
      In both row 2 and box 5, only candidates 3, 4, 5 are present r2c4, only 4 and 5 present in r2c5,
      and only 3 and 5 present in r2c6

**Hidden Pair**
   ``45#2r3c38``
      Candidates 4 and 5 only occur twice in r3, in cells r3c3 and r3c8.  These candidates can be hidden
      by other candidates in those cells

   OR

   ``45!-r3c!38``
      Candidates 4 and 5 are not present in row 3 outside of cells r3c3 and r3c8

**Hidden Triple**
   ``259!-r1c!135``
      Candidates 2, 5 and 9 are not present in row 1 outside r1c1, r1c3 and r1c5

**Hidden Quad**
   ``2689!-r1c!1378``
      Candidates 2, 6, 8 and 9 are not present in row 1 outside r1c1, r1c3, r1c7 and r1c8

Candidate Diagrams
==================

Candidate Representation
------------------------

The Candidate Diagrams here varies somewhat from those described in
`Sudopedia <http://sudopedia.enjoysudoku.com/Diagrams_and_Notations.html>`_ and the
`Sudoku Forum <https://forum.enjoysudoku.com/>`_.

The contents of a Candidate Diagram Cell is made up of the following components

.. _tbl-cand-diag-comps:

.. list-table:: Candidate Diagram Symbol Components
   :widths: 10 90
   :align: left
   :width: 97%

   *  -  X
      -  A unique but unspecified candidate value can/may be present
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="underline">X</span>`
      -  (underline) A unique but unspecified candidate value must be present
   *  -  \+
      -  An appended “+” indicates presence of additional candidates
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="overline">X</span>`
      -  (overline) Not X, X must be absent
   *  -  \*
      -  (wildcard) Any Candidate indicated in the pattern can be eliminated.
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="strikethrough">X</span>`
      -  (strikethrough) If Candidate is present, it can be eliminated.

These components are combined in cells for further pattern meaning.  This is not an exhaustive list of all possible Candidate combinations, but hopefully enough to develop the understanding necessary for their use.

.. _tbl-cand-diag-symbs:

.. list-table:: Candidate Diagram Symbols
   :widths: 10 90
   :align: left
   :width: 97%

   *  -  X+
      -  X can/may be present with other candidates (verbose form of X)
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="underline">XY</span>`
      -  XY are the only two candidates
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="underline">XY</span>`\+
      -  X and Y must be present, optionally other candidates too
   *  -  XY
      -  At least two of X and Y must be the only values present (synonym of :raw-html:`<span class="underline">XY</span>`)
   *  -  XY\+
      -  X and Y must be present, optionally other candidates too (synonym of :raw-html:`<span class="underline">XY</span>`\+)
   *  -  XYZ
      -  At least two of X, Y, and Z must be the only values present
   *  -  XYZ\+
      -  At least two of X, Y,  and Z must be present, optionally other candidates too
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="underline">XY</span>`\Z
      -  X and Y must be present, optionally Z, and no other candidates
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="underline">XYZ</span>`
      -  X, Y, and Z are the only candidates present
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="underline">XYX</span>`\+
      -  X, Y and Z must be present optionally other candidates too
   *  -  WXYZ
      -  At least two of W, X, Y and Z must be the only values present
   *  -  WXYZ\+
      -  At least two of W, X, Y, and Z must be present optionally other candidates too
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="underline">WX<s/pan>`\YZ
      -  W and X must be present, optionally Y and Z and no other candidates
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="underline">WXY</span>`\Z+
      -  W, X and Y must be present, optionally Z and other candidates
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="underline">WXYZ</span>`
      -  All of W, X, Y and Z are the only values present
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="underline">WXYZ<span>`\+
      -  All of W, X, Y, and Z must be present, optionally other candidates too
   *  -  X\*
      -  Any candidate other X can be eliminated
   *  -  :raw-html:`<span class="underline">XY</span>`\Z\*
      -  X and Y must be present, optionally Z present and any other candidate can be eliminated

Many patterns rely on the presence of Candidate values anywhere in the intersection of a line and
a box.  For these patterns, Candidate Diagrams merge the three cells in the intersection into one
larger cell containing the union of the Candidates in the intersecting cells.

Some Examples
-------------

Locked Exposed Pair
+++++++++++++++++++

.. _fig-locked-exposed-pair-cd1:

.. figure:: images/locked-exposed-pair-cd1.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Locked Exposed Pair
   :align: right
   :figwidth: image

   Locked Exposed Pair Pattern

The exposed pair XY is confined to the intersection of r1 and b1.  \* indicates all the cells that
can see the cells of the exposed pair.  If X or Y exists in the cells with a \*, they can be eliminated.

Y-Wing
++++++

.. _fig-y-wing-cd1:

.. figure:: images/y-wing-cd1.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Y-Wing
   :align: right
   :figwidth: image

   Y-Wing Pattern

Z is true at either or both pincers (Zr3r6 and Xr8c2).  Therefore, any same value
candidate that sees both ends such as Zr8c6 cannot be true and can be eliminated.

Locked Pointing Single
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _fig-locked-pointing-single-cd1:

.. figure:: images/locked-pointing-single-cd1.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Locked Pointing Single
   :align: right
   :figwidth: image

   Locked Pointing Single Pattern

Because X is present in the intersection of row 3 and box 3, and not present in the
rest of box 3, X must be True in the intersection.  Therefore, any X that is present
along row 3 outside the intersection cannot be True and can be eliminated.

|

XYZ-Wing
++++++++

.. _fig-xyz-wing-cd1:

.. figure:: images/xyz-wing-cd1.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: XYZ-Wing
   :align: right
   :figwidth: image

   XYZ-Wing Pattern

XYZr1c2, in the intersection of ensures that the Unrestricted Candidate, Y must be True
in at least one of the cells forming the pattern.  Therefore, any other Candidate Y that
can see all occurrences of Y in the pattern can be eliminated.  The only locations that
can see all the pincers and pivot lies in the intersection of row 1 and box 1.

Locked Exposed Triple
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. _fig-locked-exposed-triple-cd1:

.. figure:: images/locked-exposed-triple-cd1.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Locked Exposed Triple
   :align: right
   :figwidth: image

   Locked Exposed Triple Pattern

X, Y, Z are the only candidates confined (locked) to the intersection of row 3 and box 3,
with no other candidates, they identify an Exposed Triple.  X, Y, Z are True in the cells of the
Exposed Triple, therefore any Ccells that can see all the same value Ccells in the Exposed
Triple cannot be True and can be eliminated.



2.1.3.6.   Straight Subsets
Exposed Subsets:
345==r5c268	345 are the only candidates in the combination of cells r5c2, r5c6, r5c8 in row 5.
Hidden Subsets
34!-r2c!235	Candidates 34 are not present in r2 outside of r2c2, r2c3, r2c5.  That is 34 is only present in r2c235
2.1.3.7.   Fish
Base Set Lines precede Cover Set Lines.
9c234r135,r7c3	Candidate 9 with bases in columns 2, 3 and 4, covers in rows 1, 3, and 5 with a fin in r7c3.

2.1.3.8.   Chains, Loops and Nets
Follows AIC notation
4r2c7=5r2c7-5r2c2=4r2c2-4r3c1=5r3c1-5r6c1=4r6c1  (prefer expanded)
(4=5)r2c7-(5=4)r2c2-(4=5)r3c1-(5=4)r6c1

Loops
Note last appended link indicating last ccell linked to first ccell.
4r2c7=5r2c7-5r2c2=4r2c2-4r3c1=5r3c1-5r2c1=2r2c7~  (prefer expanded)

Single digit chains
4(r2c7=r2c2-r3c1=r6c1)
4r2c7=4r2c2-4r3c1=4r6c1  (preferred expanded)

Bi-Value Cell Nets – Remote Pairs
(2=8)(r8c4~r5c4{~r5c9~r4c7~r4c6, ~r7c4~r2c4~r2c8})
(1=8)(r1c1{~r1c7~r2c9{~r2c5,~r4c9~r4c6~r5c6},~r3c3})  (prefer compacted, expanded (not shown) is too verbose)
Note:  Braces group all the Children of a Node.

Bi-Value (XY-) Chains and Loops
(2=3)r2c6-(3=5)r7c6~(5=9)r7c5~(9=2)r5c5  (prefer compacted, expanded is too verbose)

Strong Linked Nets
1r1c1n=1r1c4p=1r6c4n={1r6c7p=1r4c7n=1r4c5p=1r2c5n=1r2c1p,9r6c4p}
Note:

    1. All the links are Strong
    2. Braces are used to group all the Children of a Node.
    3. Ccells are postfixed with a polarity symbol, “n” or “p”.  All nodes in a Strong net have polarity. Polarity indicates a possible Truth.  Either the one polarity or the other polarity is the Truth, however which it is, is unknown.

2.1.3.9.   Bent Subsets
Exposed Bent Subsets
34\56r7Ub9	Candidates 3456 form a Bent Exposed Quad in r7 and b9 where 5 has been identified as the unrestricted candidate.

Grouped Bent Subsets
345(r3Ib3,==r3c14,!-b3p!15)  Candidate 345 lie in the intersection of row 3 and box 3 (r3c789) where the exposed subset is in the rows, r3c14, and the hidden subset is in the box, where 345 is not present in positions 1, 5 in box 3. - that is only present in b3p15, or r1c7 and r2c8.
2.1.3.10.   Unlocked Sets
Z(ALS1)X1(ALS2)X2(ALS3)Z
1(127r1c3,89r2c3,279r3c3,189r5c3)27(278r1c1)8(78r1c9,79r3c9,16r4c9,69r6c9)1

2(26r7c2,246r9c1)4(46r2c4,24r9c4)4(46r2c1,26r3c2)2–
Note:

    1. The candidates Z and X can be individual or sets of.
    2. The dash on the end of the last example indicates that this is an ULS-loop where the end candidate can directly see the starting candidate.

2.1.3.11.   Complex Patterns
Chained Strong Linked Nets.
[1r1c1n=1r1c4p=1r6c4n={1r6c7p=1r4c7n=1r4c5p=1r2c5n=1r2c1p,9r6c4p}]
<1r1c4p-5r1c4n>
[4r5c4n={4r9c4p={4r9c5n=7r9c5p,5r9c4n={5r1c4p,5r8c6p}},9r5c4p}],
4r9c5-4r2c5-1r2c5
Note:

    1. Each Strong Linked Net is braced with Square brackets
    2. The phrase describing the relationship between the two chains is braced with Pointy brackets <1r1c4p-5r1c5n>
