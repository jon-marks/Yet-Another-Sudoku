Chains, Loops and Nets
**********************

In this section, a Node refers to a Ccell that is part of a Chain, Loop or Net pattern to
distinguish it from Ccells that are not part of that pattern.

This section builds substantially on the :ref:`Truths <a-truth>` and
:ref:`Premises and Inferences <premises-and-inferences>` concepts developed in
:ref:`Core Concepts <core-concepts>`.

A Link is an inference describing the relationship between two Ccells.  A Direct Link describes the
relationship between two Ccells that see each directly.  An Indirect Link describes the relationship
between two Ccells that are connected indirectly by a pattern such as a chain, etc.

Direct Links
============

Recall:
   *  :ref:`Direct Weak Links <weak-links>`:  If one end is True, the other end must be False, and
      that both ends cannot be simultaneously True, but can be simultaneously False.  These Links
      characterise the following Ccell relationships:

      *  Between two same valued Ccells in a House that has 3 or more same valued Ccells.
      *  Between two different valued Ccells in a cell that has 3 or more Ccells.

   *  :ref:`Direct Strong Links <strong-links>`:  The ends are always the opposite state of each
      other.  The ends cannot be simultaneously True or False.  These Links characterise the following
      Ccell relationships

      *  Between the only two same valued Ccells in a house (a Conjugate Pair).
      *  Between the only two Ccells in a Cell (Bi-value Cell)

Chains and Nets
===============

Chains
------

A chain is simply a stream of inferences (links).  Starting with an assertion of a premise (state is
True or False) of a Ccell at one end, and propagating the inferences from Ccell to Ccell reaching
another end Ccell.

The only link patterns that propagate in chains are:
   *  concatenated Strong Links forming Strong Link Chains (SLC), and
   *  alternating Strong and Weak Links forming Alternating Inference Chains (AIC).

Concatenating Weak Links cannot propagate because it is impossible to infer the state of a next
node from a False node.

A Chain of 'n' nodes will have 'n - 1' links.

A Node can only be used once in the construction of a chain.  If a specific node is encountered a
second time in a chain, then a loop can be formed by pruning the chain in front of the first
occurrence of the node, and have the chain link back on itself.  Any other cross-linking of nodes
in a chain breaks the inference logic forming the chain.

Chain Patterns are productive when they form indirect links that behave as Weak Links, Strong Links,
or Robust Links.

Nets
----

A Chain is made up of interior Nodes that are linked to Nodes on either side and two End Nodes that
are linked to an Interior Node.  A net or a tree structure permits Nodes to link to more than two
Nodes.

In its simplest form, a chain is a Net or Tree with no branches off the Trunk.  If this chain is
picked up by an interior Node, making that node the Base of the Net, it forms a Net of two branches.

In a Sudoku Grid, it is possible for a Node to have a branch to every Node that it can see.  A
potential maximum of 32 weak links or 4 strong links to children.

Alternate Inference Nets are constructed to search for productive Alternate Inference Chains in
Sudoku puzzles, where each chain is a path from each Net leaf back to the base.

Strong Linked Nets are productive in their own right with the
resolution techniques that depend on adjacent net level nodes always having opposite True/False
state.

Net generations of Children / Tree branches grow until:
   *  No more children / branches can be found
   *  A child / branch loops back on its chain created so far.
   *  The maximum recursion limit is reached. Nets / Trees grow by successively recusing down all the
      children found at each level.  The growth in nodes is    explosive often exceeding tens of
      millions of nodes, especially when considering Group Link Nodes.  It is practical to limit the
      successive levels searched to contain the time required to find a chain or not.

Indirect Links
==============

Weak Link Ended Alternating Inference Chains (WE-AIC)
-----------------------------------------------------

Consider two end Nodes A and B connected with AI Linked six node Chain, where the end links are Weak
Links.

:raw-html:`</span></p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre>A - W = X - Y = Z - B</pre>
</div></div>
<p><span>`

The chain's inferences are described in the following table.

   ==================================================================================================================================== ================================

A WE-AIC has an Even Node count to preserve the weak end link requirement of the chain. If an End
Node is True, the other is False, and if the other end is True, then the first is False.  The chain
identifies a reversible opposing inference relationship (True to False) between the End Nodes.
The ends of WE-AIC behave in the same as :ref:`Weak Links <weak-links>`.

With an Odd Node count chain, if the one end is True, so is the other.  But the chain is not
reversible. The other starting link is Strong, and a True assertion from that end does not
propagate passed the second link.  This passing forward of the True state in one direction may be
useful.  But it is this reversible opposing inference relationship found in Even Node
Count chains that gives them the same behaviour as Weak Links.  And like weak links, can be used in
the characterisation of Truths.

The symbol :raw-html:`<mono>"|-|"</mono>` describes the indirect linkage of the end Nodes of a WE-AIC.  The bars
indicating that the end nodes are indirectly related.

Strong Link Ended Alternating Inference Chains (SE-AIC)
-------------------------------------------------------

Consider two end Nodes A and B connected with AI Linked six node Chain, where the end links are
Strong Links.

:raw-html:`</span></p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre>A = W - X = Y - Z = B</pre>
</div></div>
<p><span>`

The chain's inferences are described in the following table.

   ==================================================================================================================================== ===============================

A SE-AIC has an Even node count to preserve the strong end link requirement of the chain.  If an End
Node is False, the other is True, and if the other is False then the first is True.  The chain
identifies a reversible opposing inference relationship (False to True) between the end Nodes. The
ends of a SE-AIC behave like :ref:`Robust Links <robust-links>`.

With an Odd Node count chain, if the one end is False so is the other.  But the chain is not
reversible. The other starting link is Weak and a False assertion from that end does not propagate.
This False to False one way passing forward may be useful.  But it is this reversible opposing
inference relationship found in Even Node count chains that give it the behavior of Robust Links.

The Robust Link symbol :raw-html:`<mono>"|~|"</mono>` describes the indirect linkage of the end Nodes of a
SE-AIC.  The bars indicating that the end nodes are indirectly related.

Because at least one end of a Robust link is always True, any Ccell (including interior nodes,
see :ref:`Cannibalism <cannibalism>` below), cannot be True and can be eliminated.

.. _strong-linked-patterns:

Strong Linked Patterns
----------------------

Chain Patterns refer to Chains, Nets and Loops.

Consider two end Nodes A and B, connected by Strongly Linked six node chain:

:raw-html:`</span></p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre>A = W = X = Y = Z = B</pre>
</div></div>
<p><span>`

The end Nodes behave exactly as a Direct Strong Link.  This relationship is indicated with a
:raw-html:`<mono>"|=|"</mono>` symbol to differentiate this Link type from a Direct Strong Link

   :raw-html:`<mono>T &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; T &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; T &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; F</mono>`  If A is True then B is False
   :raw-html:`<mono>F &nbsp;&larr;&nbsp; T &nbsp;&larr;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&larr;&nbsp; T &nbsp;&larr;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&larr;&nbsp; T</mono>`  If B is True then A is False
   :raw-html:`<mono>F &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; T &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; T &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; T</mono>`  If A is False then B is True
   :raw-html:`<mono>T &nbsp;&larr;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&larr;&nbsp; T &nbsp;&larr;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&larr;&nbsp; T &nbsp;&larr;&nbsp; F</mono>`  If B is False then A is True
   ==================================================================================================================================== =============================

Because one end of a Strongly Linked Chain is always True, any other Ccell (including interior
nodes, see :ref:`Cannibalism <cannibalism>` below), cannot be True and can be eliminated.

However, an SLC or SLN physically requires at least two nodes of each state, for another Ccell to
see a node of either State.  Therefore, the minimum node count for a productive SLC or Net is four
with two of either state.  In an SLC there will always be 'n / 2' nodes of either state, but not
necessarily in a SLN where is possible for four Nodes to be made up of one parent and three
children.  In this scenario it is physically not possible to for any cell to see a node of either
state.

Strong Linked Chains have a valuable additional property which greatly increases its productivity.
All consecutive nodes of a Strongly linked chain will always be of opposite state.  Therefore, any
Ccell that is not part of the pattern that sees both an odd count Node and even count Node in the
chain cannot be True and can be eliminated.  This property envelops the Strong Link property because
Chain End Nodes of an Even node count Strongly Linked Chain will always have opposing state.

.. _super-node:

In working with Strong Linked Chains it is useful to consecutively number the nodes from one end to
the other and identify odd and even parity nodes.  Similarly, odd and even parity nodes are
determined by the parity of the net level count.  Odd and even parity nodes will have opposing (yet
to be determined) state.  Therefore, any Ccell that is not part of the SL pattern that sees two
nodes in the pattern of opposing parity cannot be True and can be eliminated.

All the odd parity nodes are grouped into the Odd Parity Super Node Set of the SL pattern.
Similarly, the even parity are grouped int the Even Parity Super Node Set of the SL pattern. These
two Super-Nodes are Strongly linked, implying all the Nodes in each set are strongly linked to all
the nodes in the other set.

When solving as humans, it is useful use different colours to distinguish parity.

.. _chained-strong-linked-pattern:

Chained Strong Linked Patterns
------------------------------

Developed from:
   |   http://www.sudocue.net/guide.php#MedusaBridge, and
   |   http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/3d-medusa-help-on-a-specific-puzzle-t31070.html.

Often puzzles with multiple SL Patterns have node in each pattern that see nodes in other SL
patterns.  These nodes form a Weak Link between the SL pattern.  From the perspective of the SL
pattern being two Strongly Linked :term:`Super-Node`\s, a chain of Super-Nodes is formed.

The Types 1, 2, and 3 pattern resolutions available to AI-Chains are also available to these 'Super
Node' AI-Chains where the actual chain end nodes can be any in the end 'Super-Nodes'.

Unlike regular SL Nets, Chained SL Nets can be of any Super Node count.  Each 'Super-Node' set
can be as small as one node.

Some Chain Examples
===================

It is illustrative to provide some examples, simply to explain the mechanics of what is being
discussed.  The practicalities associated with identifying and resolving these patterns are covered
in :ref:`Human Solvable Chain Patterns <human-solvable-chain-patterns>`.

A Two String Kite

   Two String Kite Example

The chain in this example is :raw-html:`<mong>5r2c7=5r9c7-5r8c9=5r8c4</mong>`, source:
`Hodoku <http://hodoku.sourceforge.net/en/tech_sdp.php#t2sk>`__.  This is an alternating strong/weak
link chain four nodes long starting and ending with a strong link.  A short chain was chosen for
simplicity but the logic applies to any even node count chain.

Starting at with ccell 5r2c7, assert the premise that it is False. The strong link between 5r2c7 and
5r9c7, infers 5r9c7 True.  The weak link between 5r9c7 and 5r8c9 infers 5r8c9 False.  The strong
link between 5r8c9 and 5r8c4 infers 5r8c4 True.  Also walking the chain in the opposite direction
starting with 5r8c4 as False will ultimately infer 5r2c7 True.  Thus concluding neither 5r2c7 nor
5r8c4 can be simultaneously False, one or the other has to be True.

But with this AIC if 5r2c7 is asserted True, then 5r8c4 can be either True or False.  For example,
The premise that 5r2c7 is True, infers 5r9c7 False.  Because 5r9c7 is weakly linked to 5r8c9,
nothing can be inferred about its state when it is False, which breaks the inferences for the rest
of the chain.

The important conclusions to be drawn from AIC/Inferred links is that same value candidates that can
see both ends of the AIC can be eliminated.  This is because at least one end Ccell will always be
True.  In this example 5 is eliminated from r2c4 (r2c4-=5).

<http://hodoku.sourceforge.net/en/tech_sdp.php#sk>`__.  This is another AI chain of four nodes with
strong end links.  Note that the centre link is a Strong Link masquerading as a Weak Link.

Walking the chain exactly like the previous example, the indirect Robust link
:raw-html:`<mong>1r1c6|~|1r2c9</mong>` is found.  Recall that at least one end will always be true,
therefore any Ccell that can see both ends cannot be True.  Four such Ccells exist in this pattern
which can be eliminated: :raw-html:`<mong>r1c7-=1, r1c8-=1, r3c4-=1, r3c5-=1</mong>`.

A Strong Linked Net (SLN) Chain

Here is an example of three Strong Linked Nets in a Chain.  Source: `SudokuWiki <https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Aligned_Pair_Exclusion>`__

The three chains are:

*  :raw-html:`<mong>SLN1 = 3r1c1e=3r1c6o=5r1c6e</mong>`
*  :raw-html:`<mong>SLN2 = 1r1c1e=1r1c4o=1r6c4e={1r6c7o=1r4c7e=1r4c5o=1r2c5e={1r2c1o,2r2c5o},9r6c4o}</mong>`
*  :raw-html:`<mong>SLN3 = 4r2c1e=4r2c6o=4r3c6e=4r3c1o</mong>`

Viewed from the perspective of Odd and Even Parity Super Nodes:

*  :raw-html:`<mong>SLN1e = {3r1c1, 5r1c6}</mong>`
*  :raw-html:`<mong>SLN1o = {3r1c6}</mong><br><br>`

*  :raw-html:`<mong>SLN3e = {4r2c6, 4r3c1}</mong>`

These three chains are linked by:

*  :raw-html:`<mong>SLN2o-SLN3e &nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp; 1r2c1-4r2c1</mong>`

The Super Node Chain is:

*  :raw-html:`<mong>SLN1o=SLN1e-SLN2e=SLN2o-SLN3e=SLN3o</mong>`

Because :raw-html:`<mong>3r1c6</mong> in SLN1o and <mong>4r2c6</mong> in SLN3o are in the same
house, and because of the Chain, at least one of them will be True, any Ccell (such as
<mong>3r2c6</mong>) that sees both, cannot be True and can be eliminated <mong>r2c6-=3</mong>`.

Chain Eliminations and Placements
=================================

Weak Link Ended Chains (WE-AIC)
-------------------------------

Recall, Weak Link Ended AI-Chain characteristics are:
   *  An even count of Nodes,
   *  Link count is one less than Node Count, an odd number,
   *  Both outer links are Weak Links,
   *  Reversible.  Asserting the one end True and traversing the inferences will find the other end
      False.
   *  Although both ends cannot be simultaneously True, they can be simultaneously False.

The ends of Weak Link Ended Chains behave exactly as Weak Links and can be used as such.  Ccells
'See' each other through weak links.  Two Ccells that 'See' each other both cannot be True.  This
application of the Sudoku rule on its own, does not give much.  Its real power is in linking Ccells
to all the elements of :ref:`'A Truth' <a-truth>`.  If a Ccell sees all the elements of 'A Truth',
it cannot be True and can be eliminated

This will be covered in detail when reviewing the application of :ref:`Kraken Fish <kraken-fish>`.

Strong Link Ended Chains (SE-AIC)
---------------------------------

Recall, Strong Ended AI-Chain characteristics are that of :ref:`Robust Links <robust-links>`:
   *  An even count of Nodes
   *  Link count is one less than Node Count, an odd number,
   *  Both outer links are Strong Links,
   *  Reversible.  Asserting the one end False and traversing the inferences will find the other end
      True.
   *  Although both ends cannot be simultaneously False, they can be simultaneously True.

Because at least one end of a SE-AIC is always True, any Ccell (including interior nodes, see
:ref:`Cannibalism <cannibalism>`) seeing both ends cannot be True and can be eliminated.

Type 1:  Same end Values
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Considering SE-AIC's with the same candidate values, eliminations depend on the locations of the
ends relative to each other:

   Robust Link Same House Candidate Diagram

With ends in the Same :term:`House`, seven cells can see both ends.  In the figure on the right,
hypothetical chain ends are marked X and the cells that can see both ends are highlighted green.
Any same valued Ccell in the highlighted green cells cannot be True and can be eliminated.

Furthermore and perhaps more importantly, An :ref:`Even Loop <even-loops>` by the SE-AIC ends seeing
each other.  An Even Loop pattern strengthens all the weak links, causing all the other same value
Ccells in the Weak Links never to be True, resulting in their elimination.

Type 2:  Different End Values
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Eliminations are only possible if the different ends occur in the same house or cell.

In this grid snippet say :raw-html:`<mong>2r3c2</mong> and <mong>7r3c8</mong> are the chain ends.
<mong>7r3c2</mong> can see both chain ends.  Therefore, it cannot be True and can be

<mong>7r6c3</mong> and <mong>6r6c7</mong> can both see both chain ends and can be eliminated.
<mong>r6c3-=7</mong> and <mong>r6c7-=6</mong>`.

To summarise: Considering different value chain ends of a SE-AIC in the same house, if a Ccell of
same value as the one end is in the other end, it can be eliminated.  This pattern can yield a
maximum of two eliminations.

that are not part Chain can both see both end of the chain, and therefore cannot be True and can be

Ccells in the Chain end cells respectively, and they can be placed.  <mong>r4c2:=9</mong> and
<mong>r4c5:=5</mong>`.

Strong Linked Patterns
----------------------

Recall, SL Patterns:
   *  Have alternating State Consecutive Nodes.
   *  Are reversible, inferences can be traversed in either direction with same predictable results.

More is gained by working with SL Net patterns than SL Chain patterns.
   *  Net patterns typically capture more nodes than string patterns.
   *  A Ccell can only be a member of a single SL Net, whereas, the same Ccell can be a member of
      multiple SL Chains.
   *  A Puzzle typically contains fewer larger SL-Nets than chains, thereby reducing the search
      effort for similar outcomes.

Recall further:
   *  SL Patterns members can be divided into two Super-Nodes of even and odd parity.  SL Chain
      parity is found by assigning count numbers to each consecutive nodes. SL Node parity is found
      by assigning the level number to the Node.  In both cases, all odd and even Nodes to their
      respective Super-Node.
   *  Either all the Even or all the Odd Parity nodes will True.  Which it is, is yet to be
      determined.
   *  A Strong link exists between the odd and even Super-Nodes of SL patterns.  Any node in the one
      Super-Node set is strongly linked to all nodes in the other Super Node.

Sub Chains
==========

Source: http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/x-chain-optimalisation-t38330.html.

An important observation about AI Chains with 6 or more Nodes, any lesser even amount consecutive
count of 4 or more nodes is also a valid chain.  Software algorithms can deal with this
automagically.  However, as humans it is helpful to keep this in mind when working with chains.


.. _cannibalism:

Cannibalism
===========

In an AI-Chain pattern, if one of the interior Nodes sees both ends of the Chain, can this Node be
eliminated without breaking the chain?

To answer this we need to distinguish between the pattern used to identify a condition, and the
condition.  The condition in this case is the inference (direct or indirect link) between two
Ccells.  That condition exists, whatever the current state of the puzzle.  The condition belongs to
the solution of a puzzle and not its current state.  The condition is unvarying as the solution of a
puzzle does not change.

A pattern, in contrast, is dependent on the current state of a puzzle to identify a condition.
SE-AIC patterns identify Ccells that both cannot be simultaneously True, This an unvarying condition
of the puzzle that has been identified.  This condition does not change as puzzle state continuously
changes as it is solved.

Therefore, patterns such as AI Chains can be cannibalistic and consume their interior links.

.. _loops:

AI Loops
========

An AI loop is an AI Chain that loops back on itself.  An even length AIC looping back on itself has
the same strong and weak link count.  An odd length AIC that loops back on itself can either have an
extra strong link or extra weak link in the loop; an odd count loop has either two adjacent strong
links or two adjacent weak links.

These three loop types result in different eliminations or placements.

.. _even-loops:

Even AI Loops
-------------

Consider the following Even AI-Loop:

:raw-html:`</span></p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre>A = B – C = D –</pre>
</div></div>
<p><span>`

The ending dash indicates a weak link looping back to Node A.  If Node A is False, the AI Chain
ensures D is True.  If Node A is True, the looped weak link to Node D ensures that Node D is False.
Thus, the Weak link between Nodes D and A is made Strong by the loop.  The same is said for the Weak
link between Nodes B and C.

Since the Loop strengthens all the Weak links in the AI Chain, The same eliminations and placements
that apply to :ref:`Strong Linked Patterns <strong-linked-patterns>`, apply to Even AI Chains.

Strong Loops
------------

Consider the following Strong AI-Loop:

:raw-html:`</span></p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre>A = B – C = D – E =</pre>
</div></div>
<p><span>`

The ending '=' indicates a strong link looping back from Node E to node A.  Node A is the only node
in the chain sporting two strong links.

If Node A is False, then both Nodes B and E are True because of the Strong Links.  But B and E
cannot be simultaneously True because :raw-html:`<mong>B - C = D - E</mong>` is a WE-AIC.
A contradiction exists when Node A is False.  Therefore, Node A must be True and can be placed.

Weak Loops
----------

Consider the following Weak AI Loop:

:raw-html:`</span></p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre>A = B – C = D – E –</pre>
</div></div>
<p><span>`

The ending dash indicates a weak link looping back from Node E to Node A.  Node E is the only node
in the chain sporting two weak links.

If Node E is True, then both Nodes A and D are False because of the Weak Links.  But A and D cannot
be simultaneously True because :raw-html:`<mong>A = B - C = D</mong>` is a SE-AIC.  A contradiction
exists when Node E is True.  Therefore, Node A can only be False and can be eliminated.

Observe that this is a narrower pattern than an AI-Chain Type 1.  Ccell E sees both ends of an
SE-AIC, and therefore, cannot be True and can be eliminated.  A SE-AIC Type 1 deals with all Ccells
that can see both chain ends at once, whereas the Weak Loop deals with each Ccell that sees both
chain ends individually.

Group Links
===========

Characterising Group Links
--------------------------

It is possible to group Ccells that lie within a Line/Box intersection into a 'Grouped Node' that
can be considered as a Node when identifying Strong Linked Nodes in patterns.

   Group Link Example Candidate Diagram

By taking advantage of the Locked Singles property of line / box intersections, it is possible to
group ccells in these intersections as a grouped ccell.  These grouped ccells in the line / box
intersections behave much like regular ccells in the formation of links and chains.


Consider same candidate value ccells A, B and C.  Each ccell is weakly linked to the other two
ccells, A-B, B-C and A-C.  However, because B and C are also housed in box 3, they can be grouped
together and treated as a “Truth unit”.  Now A and the grouping of B and C form a strong link.
A=(BC).

In isolation, this linkage does not yield much, however when used in the formation of other
patterns like chains, may yield many more productive outcomes.

If the Grouped Ccell BC is False, then both B and C must be False.  If BC is True, then only one
of B or C is True.  Both B and C being True will violate :ref:`Sudoku Rules <sudoku-rules>`.

By taking advantage of the Locked Singles property of line / box intersections, it it is possible to group ccells in these intersections as a grouped ccell.  These grouped ccells in the line / box intersections behave much like regular ccells in the formation of links and chains.
[TODO – fix with correct concept diag syntax]

Consider same candidate value ccells A, B and C.  Each ccell is weakly linked to the other two ccells, A-B, B-C and A-C.  However because B and C are also housed in box 3, they can be grouped together and treated as a “Truth unit”.  Now A and the grouping of B and C form a strong link.  A=(BC).  This linkage in isolation does not give us much, however when used in the formation of chains, may be able to give us a whole lot by creating validly linked chains, where links would have otherwise not existed.

Expressed in Cell Grammar, say for example the candidate value is 5:
    • A is 5r2c2, B is 5r2c7 and C is 5r2c9
    • The weak links are:
        ◦ 5(r2c2-r2c7), 5(r2c2-r2c9) and 5(r2c7-r2c9)
    • The strong grouped ccell link is:
        ◦ 5(r2c2=r2c79).  Note the two column values in the grouped ccell.


Extending the above example, in addition to A, B and C, consider additional same value ccells, D, E and F, where D and E are strongly linked, and both A and E “see” F.  If A is strongly linked to E, then it is possible to eliminate ccell F.  Only by grouping B and C, does it become possible to form the strong ended chain:
	A=(BC)~D=E, or in cell grammar:
	5(r2c2=r2c79~r3c8=r7c8), thus forcing the elimination of 5r7c2.

Note the use of “~” to denote a strong link masquerading as a weak link.


Group Link Properties
---------------------

[TODO Correct with concept diag syntax]
    • Group links are only formed as strong links:
        ◦ Along a line (row or column) where the only common candidates are bounded by two boxes..  For example:.

The green links are correct: a(r2c1=r2c79), a(r2c1=r56c1) and a(r8c23=r8c789). Incorrect link highlighted in red.  No no inference can be drawn between ar5c8 and ar6c5.  If ar5c8 is False, ar6c5 can be either true of False.  Similarly if ar6c5 is True, are6c5 can be True or False.
        ◦ Between the only common candidates in a box that form two lines or a cell and a line. The lines can be:
            ▪ A cell and a line in the box, for example: b4, a(r5c123=r6c3)
            ▪ Either two rows or columns in the box, for example: b5, a(r4c46=r6c56)
            ▪ A row and column in box, for example: b1, a(r1c23=r23c1); b3, a(r1c79=r23c8); b4, a(r5c12=r56c3); b8, a(r789c4=r9c56) or a(r78c4=r9c456).
            ▪ Observe that some patterns produce two sets of strong links.

[TODO ditto – plus fix colouring alternating for adj link]


    • Joining Grouped strong links in AI Chains.  Best explained by following the construction of the following group linked AI Chain.  Solid lines are strong links, dashed lines weak links.

[TODO diito.  Plus correct per discription below.]

The Chain starts with the strong link ‘a’(r23c1=r1c23).  This Strong link cannot connect to a(r12c5=r5c5) because:  If both ar23c1 is False, then one of ar1c23 is True.  Irrespective of which of ar1c23 is True, ar1c5 is False, but no inference can be drawn about ar2c5, it could be True or False.  Therefore it is not possible to make an inference from ar1c23 that will cause both ar23c5 to be False, hence the chain cannot propagate along this path.

However, if one of ‘a’r1c23 is True, then both ‘a’r1c79 are False, therefore one of strongly linked ‘a’r23c8 is True, making ar6c8 False, making ar5c9 True, making both ar78c9 False, making one of ‘a’r9c78 True.  In this chain if all the candidates in blue cells are False, then of the cells in the green groupings are True.  Therefore any cell grouping in the same house as the green group is False.  The chain propagates in reverse from ‘a’r9c78 to ‘a’r23c1 where if all green cell groupings are False one of the cells in the blue groupings will be True.  Therefore, because if both ‘a’r23c1 are False, one of ‘a’r9c78 is True, and if both ‘a’r9c78 are False, one of ‘a’r23c1 is True.  Therefore this chain ensures ‘a’  is True in either or both c1 and r9.  Therefore  ‘a’r9c1 (highlighted red) can never be True and can be eliminated.

There are other interesting conditions in this pattern:

    • The chain creates a “Robust” link between ‘a’r23c1 and ‘a’r23c8, that is, both these chain nodes with ensure a Truth in both rows 2 and 3.  Therefore no other cell in row 2 and 3 can be True and can be eliminated.  ‘a’r2c5 can be eliminated.
    • There is another chain that forms a loop. ‘a’(r5c5=r1c5-r1c79=r23c8-r6c8=r5c9~).  A loop, strengthens all the weak links in a chain resulting in the elimination of ‘a’r9c8.  Note that the original loop between ‘a’(r23c1|~|r9c7) is still valid.
    • With ‘a’r2c5 gone, If ‘a’r2c1 is True, then ‘a’r3c1 and ‘a’r2c8 are False, making ‘a’r3c8 True.  And vice-versa for ‘a’r3c1 and ‘a’r2c8.  Therefore no other nodes in c1 and c8 can be True (This is an X-Wing fish pattern).  ‘a’r6c8 can eliminated.
    • There is another grouped Even X Loop.  ‘a’(r23c1=r1c23-r1c79=r23c8~), strengthening the link in r1 resulting in the elimination of ‘a’r1c5.
    • ‘a’r5c5 is the only Truth in column five and can be placed, resulting in the elimination of ‘a’r5c9.
    • Oops!  There are no ‘a’candidates left in b6.  This is an incomplete pattern.  An extra candidate ‘a’r6c9 would fix this.  Can you see that?

Group Links in Even Loops
-------------------------

An Even AI-Loop, makes all the links in the loop strong.  Therefore if a Type 1 (two same parity nodes see each other) or Type 2 (all candidates in a cell see same parity nodes).  That parity of nodes in the chain are the eliminations and the opposing parity are the placements.  But what happens if the node is a grouped ccell?

Take for example this snippet of a chain:  ...-3r6c4=3r6c79~3r4c8=2r4c8~...  If 3r6c4 is True then both 3r6c7 and 3 r6c9 are False, but if 3r6c4 is False it is not possible to know which of 3r6c7 or 3r6c9 will be True?  Therefore if there are group links in the parity of links being placed, they must be stepped over as it is not possible to know which ccell in the grouped node is the Truth.
