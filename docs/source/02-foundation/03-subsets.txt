Subsets

Subsets refer to 'n' cell by 'n' candidate grouping, where each cell in the grouping contains between
2 and 'n' of the candidates. 'n' ranges between 2 and 4, (pairs, triples and quads).  For values
of “n” > 4, a reciprocal subset relationship of 9 – 'n' candidate values exists, so it is
unnecessary to look for subsets larger than 4.

A “Straight Subset” (also simply a “Subset”) occurs when this grouping of Ccells is found in a
single house/group.  “Straight” is a bit of misnomer as the cells may not be in a straight line if
the house is Box.  A “Bent subset” occurs when this grouping of Ccells occur in two intersecting
houses/groups with at least one cell in the intersection. At least three cells are required to make
the bend. The pattern must describe at least two arms about a pivot.

Subsets can be exposed or hidden:

*  An exposed subset is where 'n' candidate values are the only values occurring between 2 and
   'n' times in the 'n' cells.
*  A hidden subset is where 'n' candidate values can are confined to 'n' cells, but are not
   necessarily the only candidates in those cells.

The logic behind resolving Straight Exposed Subsets is that the 'n' candidates can only be True in
one of the 'n' cells they collectively only occupy.  Therefore, they cannot be True outside those 'n'
cells, and any of the 'n' candidates outside the 'n' cells can be eliminated.

As the 'n' candidates are confined to only the 'n' cells in a Straight Hidden Subset, those 'n'
candidates form 'A Truth' in those 'n' cells. Therefore, any additional candidates in those 'n'
cells cannot be True and can be eliminated.

The logic for :ref:`Exposed <exp-str-ssets1>` and :ref:`Hidden <hid-str-ssets1>` Straight subsets
can be proven with a bit more algebraic rigour using :ref:`Base and Cover Sets <bsets-and-csets1>`

Bent Subset patterns are somewhat more varied and complex to identify and resolve, and are
considered in depth :ref:`here <bent-subsets-ch1>`.
