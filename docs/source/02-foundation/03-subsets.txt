Subsets
*******

Subsets refer to 'n' cell by 'n' candidate grouping, where each cell in the grouping contains between
2 and 'n' of the candidates. 'n' ranges between 2 and 4, (pairs, triples and quads).  For values
of “n” > 4, a reciprocal subset relationship of 9 – 'n' candidate values exists, so it is
unnecessary to look for subsets larger than 4.

Exposed or Hidden
=================

Subsets can be Exposed or Hidden:

*  An exposed subset is where 'n' candidate values are the only values occurring between 2 and
   'n' times in the 'n' cells.
*  A hidden subset is where 'n' candidate values can are confined to 'n' cells, but are not
   necessarily the only candidates in those cells.

Unbent or Bent
================

Subsets can be Unbent or Bent:

*  An Unbent Subsets, simply called a "Subset", refers to a collection of 'n' Candidates in 'n'
   Cells in a single :term:`Group`.
*  A “Bent subset” is a collection of 'n' Candidates in n Cells spanning the union of two
   :term:`Group`\s with at least one cell in the intersection.

Unbent Subsets
==============

In :ref:`Unbent Exposed Subsets <hsp_subsets>`, the 'n' candidates can each only be True in one of
the 'n' cells in a Group they collectively only occupy.  That is the n Candidates are
:term:`A Truth` for those n cells. Therefore, they cannot be True outside those 'n' cells.  Any
occurrence of those 'n' candidates outside the 'n' cells can be eliminated.

In :ref:`Unbent Hidden Subsets <hsp_subsets>`, the 'n' candidates are confined to only 'n' cells in
a Group, forming :term:`A Truth`.  Because of this 'Truth', any other candidates in those four cells
can be eliminated.

:ref:`Base Sets and Cover Sets <found_bsets_and_csets>` develops an algebra to verify the logic of
these Subset patterns.

:ref:`Bent Exposed Subsets <hsp_bent_exposed_subsets>` are a special case of
:ref:`Unlocked Sets <found_unlocked_sets>`, where two :term:`ULS`\s are linked in a chain with a
single :term:`Unrestricted Candidate`.

Grouped Bent Subsets
====================

:ref:`Grouped Bent Subsets <hsp_grouped_bent_subsets>` are also known as Almost Locked Candidates.
If a set of candidates are found in a line box intersection such that they can form an Exposed
Subset in the one Group and a Hidden Subset in the other Group, same value candidates can be
eliminated from other cells in the Exposed Group and from those cells forming the Hidden Subset in
the Hidden Group.

Bent Hidden Subsets

Put most of the verbiage from Bent hidden subsets in HSP (odt) here. Only how to solve the Bent
