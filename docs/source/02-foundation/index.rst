Foundation

This section is my attempt to organise the collective body of foundational material found on the
Internet and other sources into a logical consistent flow explaining concepts and how they are
related.  This section focuses more developing the theory of logic involved in solving puzzles,
mostly leaving the practical application of this theory to the next chapter on
:ref:`Human Solvable Patterns <human-solvable-patterns>`.

In the effort to be consistent and unambiguous, some terms have been refined or renamed to be:
   *  less overloaded,
   *  more consistent,
   *  more self descriptive, and
   *  relate better within the context that they are described.

To keep the reach of this text as wide as possible, verbal or algorithmic descriptions are favoured
over using less common algebraic symbols and esoteric formulae.
