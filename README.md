# Yet-Another-Sudoku

My attempt to learn python, GUI programming and sudoku solving techniques.  
Having got this far, I am looking for collaborators to help architect this 
project into a hot-shot app for playing, generating, solving Sudoku 
puzzles, and most importantly, a user friendly Sudoku techniques teaching 
tool.
